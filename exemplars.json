    "question": "Context: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70\u00b0F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.\nQuestion: Which tennis ball has more thermal energy?\nChoices: (A) the colder tennis ball (B) the hotter tennis ball ",

    "question": "Context: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nQuestion: Based on this information, what is Coco's phenotype for the body hair trait?\nChoices: (A) a hairy body (B) a hairless body ",

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating.

    "question": "Context: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.\nQuestion: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the flower color trait?\nChoices: (A) white flowers (B) red flowers ",

Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.\nA poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.\nEnd rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.\nLittle Betty Blue,\nLost her holiday shoe.\n\u2014From Mother Goose\nInternal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.\nSweet dreams of pleasant streams.\n\u2014From William Blake, \"A Cradle Song\"\nRhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.\nHe watches from his mountain walls,\nAnd like a thunderbolt he falls.\n\u2014From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \"The Eagle\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.\nFree verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.\nThe old bridge has a wrinkled face.\nHe bends his back\nFor us to go over.\n\u2014From Hilda Conkling, \"The Old Bridge\"\nThe syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.\nRepetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.\nThe dainty flying squirrel\nIn vest of shining white,\nIn coat of silver gray,\nAnd vest of shining white.\n\u2014Adapted from Mary E. Burt, \"The Flying Squirrel\"\nAlliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.\nWhere the wild men watched and waited\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.\n\u2014From Bayard Taylor, \"A Night with a Wolf\"\nOnomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:\nTlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.\n\u2014From Alfred Noyes, \"The Highwayman\"\nSometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:\nHark! the honey bee is humming.\n\u2014From Mary Howitt, \"The Voice of Spring\"\nQuestion: Adapted from Richard Aldington, \"Childhood\" and adapted from Jane Taylor, \"The Violet\"\nChoices: (A) Within a green and shady bed\nA modest violet grew;\nIts stalk was bent, it hung its head,\nAs if to hide from view. (B) It was all so dull\u2014\nExcept a few gray legs under shiny black umbrellas\nRunning along the gray shiny sidewalks. ",

    "question": "Context: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.\nThe first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws.
